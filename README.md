# CLI-API-Caller

An assignment focusing on calling APIs from the CLI using Python.

The user enters the name of a country and is then given some common information about the country   
filtered from "API #1" followed by the current weather of the countries capital, collected from "API #2".

### API #1: https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/ (No auth / key)

### API #2: https://wttr.in/ (No auth / key)

The user is then asked if the user wants to save the found common information to a .txt file followed   
by another question; "do you want to perform another search?".

I also added a few other things that weren't neccessary but I thought would be fun:
- A welcome message to try and give the app somewhat of a design
- A load bar that gradually fills up while the API calls are being made

The code is thoroughly commented, hopefully not too thoroughly. :)
